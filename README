jobexec(1)                             General Commands Manual                             jobexec(1)



NAME
       jobexec - command line batch job executor

SYNOPSYS
       jobexec <command> <cmd param 1> <cmd param 2> ...
       jobexec "<command with parameters to be executed through a shell>"


DESCRIPTION
       The  aim  of  this utility is to be invoqued from a cron or from other unattended process as a
       way to keep track of the execution of a batch job. It will execute its parameters and redirect
       stdout and stderr to files in a directory created into /var/tmp/jobexec/

       The  idea  is for this directory to contain the running outputs of batch jobs, so their execu‚Äê
       tion can be audited and or monitored.


FILES
       /var/tmp/jobexec/<processname>.<hash>.<timestamp>/
              "basedir" directory where the following status files related to the job will be left

       <basedir>/command
              the command line that was run

       <basedir>/stdout
              stdout job output

       <basedir>/stderr
              stderr job output

       <basedir>/running
              if present, the job is running, and the file contains the pid

       <basedir>/finished
              if present, the job finished, and the file contains the error level

       <basedir>/failed
              if present, the job failed to run (it couldnt be executed)

       <basedir>/bad_exit_status
              if present, the job finished with an exit status other than 0

BUGS
       It will leave output in disk, so it will accumulate over time. You can leave the expiration of
       the files up to the OS (some Unixes have a regular process that deletes unaccesed files in the
       /tmp and /var/tmp dirs).  Or you can add the following to your crontab to delete  all  reports
       older than 5 days:

       7 5 * * * jobexec find /var/tmp/jobexec/ -mtime +5 -delete -print

       jobexec  does  not currently support Unicode parameters. As a workaround you can put them in a
       shell script and inboke that script from jobexec.
